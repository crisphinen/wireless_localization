Using the tool

1. app_main.py -> caputures the fingeprint of the current location. THis is the only way a fingerprint
                    can be addded. 

2. read_db.py -> reads and formats the contents of the table that stores the fingerprints

3. clean_db.py -> resets the database that stores the fingperprints. 
                    should be used with caution.
